NEB acceleration restarted
The optimizer used for the NEB calculation is BFGS
The metric chosen is fmax 
Iteration 0 
Number images to slice from NEB Trajectory is -7. 
New training set lenght is 7. 
Starting Training, sit tight... 
Training process finished. 
Step = 2.0, ifmax = 1.0, fmax = 0.05 
Starting ML-NEB calculation... Go, and grab a cup of coffee :)
